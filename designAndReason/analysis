    - I would want the application to have a screen related to roles ie:
        - Add user
        - Edit user
        - Delete user

    - On Add user, the input field that are required to add user should be displayed.
    - A confirmation message screen should be displayed with the user details to re-confirm the submission of the user to be added
    - A back button to allow the user to be able to edit the information or cancel.
    - A confirmation message to confirm that a new user has been added successfully
    - Error messages to be display should an existing user be re-captured


    - Edit user
        - Give the user the application to be able to restrict other users based on the ranking they have.

    - Delete user
        - Display a list of user that has been added
        - Allow the user to filter based on the licenses allocated
        - Select a user from the list and click on the delete button and Display the user's information and allow
        the administrator to confirm the user details and delete.
        - Cancel button to revert the changes.
